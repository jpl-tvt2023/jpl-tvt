/**
 * TVT Chip Validation Engine
 * 
 * Validates TVT chips (Win-Win, Double Pointer, Challenge) according to league rules:
 * 
 * GENERAL RULES:
 * - TVT chips cannot be combined with FPL chips (WC, BB, FH, TC)
 * - Once announced and deadline passed, chip cannot be revoked
 * - Each chip can be used once per set (Set 1: GW1-15, Set 2: GW16-30)
 * 
 * WIN-WIN (W):
 * - Awards 2 points regardless of match result
 * - If negative hits taken, chip is wasted (counted as used, no points)
 * 
 * DOUBLE POINTER (D):
 * - Doubles TVT League points for that gameweek
 * 
 * CHALLENGE CHIP (C):
 * - Challenge any top-2 team from opposite group
 * - Win additional 2 points if they beat them
